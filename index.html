    <h2>Personal Profile Statement</h2>
    <p>
      A very meticulous, committed and dynamic criminologist with a keen eye for detail as well as an unquenchable thirst for research and investigations. I have excellent communication skills which I used to good effect as a company's liason to the Nigeria Police Force, Department of State Security, and other public security agencies. I can confidently analyse criminogenic situations and I have a sound understanding of suitable interventions to a wide array of criminal behaviour. This would help me employ strategies and measures that seek to reduce the risk of crimes occuring, and their potential harmful effects on individuals and society.
